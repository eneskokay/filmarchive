I'm a self-taught programmer and I'm learning by doing so I need to develop many projects. When My before project(it was ToDoList) I was attacking codes And When I noticed the bug I was Trying every possibility. And it was chaotic. But this project I make by watching my Udemy tutor. But I added so many new things. And this is my first OOP experience. I used to pre-ES5 But I changed to ES6. In the Css I've been careful about responsive design.
