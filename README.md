I'm a self-taught programmer and I'm learning by doing so I need to develop many project. When My before project(it was ToDoList) I was attacking to codes And When I was notice the bug I was Trying to every possibility. And it was chaotic. But this project I make it with watching to my udemy tutor. But I added so many new things. And this is my first OOP experience. I used to pre-ES5 But I changed to ES6. In the css I've been careful about responsives.
